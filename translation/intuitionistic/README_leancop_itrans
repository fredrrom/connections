leanCoP intu CNF translation (v1.2)
===================================

- Usage: leancop_itrans.sh %1 [%2]

- translates file %1 from TPTP syntax into intuitionistic clausal
  form (CNF) "cnfi(NAME,conjecture,MATRIX)." where
   a) MATRIX is a set of clauses, a clause is a set of literals,
      in which
   b) eigenvariables are skolemized -> f_skolem(i,X1,X2,...),
   c) prefix constants are skolemized -> c_skolem(i,X1,X2,...),
      and
   d) each literal is assigned a prefix -> literal:prefix,
   e) each (free) term variable is assigned a prefix -> X:prefix,
   f) each skolem term is assigned a prefix -> f_skolem(..):prefix,
      and
   g) a prefix pre(...) contains a list of variables and constants,
      pre is the empty prefix

- Example: ./leancop_itrans.sh set871
  translates TPTP file set871 into intu CNF file set871.cnf

- uses the definitional translation for the conjecture (formula)
  and the naive translation for the axioms (formulas)

- the only simplifications that are done are (1) MULT (e.g.
  [a,b,a] -> [a,b]) and (2) TAUT (e.g. [a,b,-a] -> []).

- renames "=" into "equal___"

- if no %2 is given: output file name %2 is set to %1.cnf;
  if %2 has form ???/F: output file is z/???/F.cnf, NAME is F
   (for translation of whole ILTP using the run_prover script);
  otherwise: if %2 has form F.cnf: output file is %2, NAME is F;
  otherwise: output file is %2, NAME is %2

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Changes v1.3f:
- use nanocop_tptp2.pl instead of leancop_tptp2.pl
- use new SWI Prolog options in shell script
- rename (the changed) def_mm_intu.pl to def_mm_intu_f.pl
- cleanup in shell script and leancop_main_itrans.pl

Changes (v3):
- correct union2 (prefixes are now unsigned)
- correct empty prefix to "pre" for introduced definition literals
- added "print('CNF Theorem'), nl" (used by run_prover script)

Changes (v2):
- main predicate in problem files is cnfi(...) instead of cnf(...)
- bugfix "~" (now only "-" should occur in formulas)
- prefix [a1,a2,...] is represented as "pre(a1,a2,...)"; the empty
  prefix [] is represented by "pre"
